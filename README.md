# Landing-Page
This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. The assignment was to create a sample layout. I created my own design around the NBA team Golden State Warriors. 

My goal was to test my HTML and CSS fundamentals and focus on the layout using Flexbox.

I learned a lot about structuring layouts and styling with Flexbox
